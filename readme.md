# Reusable UI Elements

My collection of simple UI Elements to reuse, restyle, animate and add functionalities in other projects.

They're desktop-first so it's up to you to implement responsiveness.

**Current status :** work in progress

| Folder/Element | Description |

| tabs-static-1  | Tabs and main content have different background colors |
| tabs-static-2  | Tabs and main content share the same background color |
| tabs-static-3  | Each tab and its content have their own background color |
