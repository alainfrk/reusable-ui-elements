# Reusable UI Elements

My collection of simple UI Elements to reuse, restyle, animate and add functionalities in other projects.

They're desktop-first so it's up to you to implement responsiveness.

**Current status :** work in progress

**Note :** Due to the CORS policy, elements relying on dynamic content may not load data correctly when accessed via the "file://" protocol. To run dynamic elements locally, you need a local server. An option is to use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.

| Folder/Element | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| boilerplate    | Starting files: HTML, CSS, and JS |
| tabs-dynamic-1 | Static layout, textual content is fetched dynamically |
| tabs-static-1  | Tabs and main content have different background colors |
| tabs-static-2  | Tabs and main content share the same background color |
| tabs-static-3  | Each tab and its content have their own background color |
