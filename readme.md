# Reusable UI Elements

My collection of simple UI Elements to reuse, restyle, animate and add functionalities in other projects.

They're desktop-first so it's up to you to implement responsiveness.

**Current status :** work in progress

**Note :** Due to the CORS policy, elements relying on dynamic content may not load data correctly when accessed via the "file://" protocol. To run dynamic elements locally, you need a local server. An option is to use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.
